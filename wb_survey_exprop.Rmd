## Data

I am using the full release of World Bank Enterprise Survey data:

```{r data_load}
wb_data <- readRDS('data/wb_data.rds') %>% as_factor
# get question labels
question_labels <- sapply(wb_data,attr,'label')
all_qs <- data_frame(q_num=question_labels,q_label=names(question_labels))
```

It contains `r nrow(wb_data)` observations from `r length(unique(wb_data$country))` countries.

Unfortunately, the data do not contain questions about expropriation risk faced by firms. I go over some proxies that come up in this data that we can use to get an initial sense of things:

## Indicators: Corruption 

Some of the following indicators reflect firm perceptions of corruption:
